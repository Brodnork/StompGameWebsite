    <main>
        <p>Hey guys.</p>
        
        <p>I'll cut straight to the point - I'm burnt out.</p>

        <p>I think it's been getting worse for a while, and the other night I realized I've been feeling like a train driving straight at a brick wall. Frogsong did not make NEARLY as much as I would have hoped, which has led to money being ridiculously tight over the past two years. Game sales drop off pretty quickly, so it's just getting tougher every month. Marketing Stomp has been a massive struggle in this world where every social media platform is falling apart. For the past several months I've been spending more time stressing over money and marketing than I have been thinking of ideas for Stomp. I've been pushing myself harder and harder to get this demo finished by May so I can get a Kickstarter going to try and keep going, but I've realized if I keep going at this pace I'm going to crash and burn. I don't want to damage my relationship to making art.</p> 

        <p>I'm taking some time off to rest. I don't know how long it'll be exactly, but I'm anticipating it'll be at least a month or two before I even touch the game again. I'll start coming up with a plan in the near future and I'll keep you guy updated when I have a better idea of what I'm going to do. Stomp and the Sword of Miracles isn't being cancelled - the game means way too much to me to do that - but it might end up taking a lot longer to come out than I'd like.</p>

        <p>Thank you all for understanding, hopefully I'll talk to you all soon.</p>
